nt|iverson200: well, declarer can switch gear and try to ruff 2 @cs, will make if @s 9x doubleton|pg||
nt|chmitty: Versace holds the @c K and can see declarer did not try to ruff @c, so he is likely to have long @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: if p holds Dx in @d he has to play a small one|pg||
nt|chmitty: Qx *|pg||
nt|iverson200: well declarer's focus would still be establishing @d for 2 losers at this point, |pg||
nt|chmitty: if Versace returns a @s what will be his move on the @d played then from dummy ?|pg||
nt|iverson200: W, knowing he has the remaining trumps may try to foce out dummy's @s AQ by returning @c, he could also return trump to cut ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'd love to "read" in Versace's mind at this point|pg||
