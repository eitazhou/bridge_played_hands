nt|Vugraphzfg: For those who are asking (and there are several)....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Play has stopped in this match.  Jimmy Cayne has had trouble concentrating.  Paramedics have been called and he is being checked out.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It is not clear what and how the match will continue.|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, cayne should be brought to some hospital, at least for basic exams  now, i do not know how things work in this context, but the TDs certainly do know|pg||
nt|reisig: They have always had medical people available at these events|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I will keep this table open as long as I can, just so I can pass out the best information as I get it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Jimmy is sitting down and talking to the paramedics, but he does look tired.|pg||
nt|USBF:  This segment has been curtailed, because everyone agreed that there was a problem with Jimmy Cayne. Paramedics are helping him. Most likely, boards 16-24 will be scored and the Cayne team will lose 3 IMPs per board for boards 25 through 30. |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Alright, I'm going to clse the room.  Jimmy is working with the paramedics.  The match will resume at 7:00.|pg||
nt|ritong: fine  thanks all for your patience|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Few of you will care, but this has been the strangest occurance in my time as a VGOP.|pg||
