nt|Fluffy: with everything working agressiveness will be rewarded|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: but in theory best contract on this cards is 6@d or 6NT|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: norgeland picked to start with 1@s which is odd, normal natural methods say you should start with 2@c|pg||
nt|Fluffy: he might had missed club fit after this start|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: 2@h is a reverse bid, showing around 16+ with at east 5-4, but the suits north has are not the ones Brogeland likes|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: Lindqvist hasn't shown his strenght yet|pg||
nt|Fluffy: after 4@c he won't let partner escape below the 6 level|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: for those unfamiliar, bidding 4m over 3NT is a natural slam try|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: meaning that south is not content with only game bonus, and wants to try for 6@c|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: that is reinforced by the fact north has shown club stopper|pg||
nt|Fluffy: 5NT looks like the pick a slam convention|pg||
nt|Fluffy: meaning: we are playing slam, but you pick the strain|pg||
nt|Fluffy: Brogeland will deduce soon that north only has 2@c or else he would know the strian|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: the only thing I dislike about 5NT is that it preempts possible grand slam ambitions but I guess south could figure out grand slam if he had a little extra|pg||
nt|Fluffy: 6@d is better than 6NT whever diamodns are 4-2 at worse, good thing about it is that it allows a club ruff to set up the suit|pg||
