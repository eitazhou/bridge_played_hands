mb|d|nt|pelu:  I see 4 losers - but in Cr E was endplayed|pg||
nt|game over: the points you have to consider are: same vulnerability, bad suit, second position (which means only one opponent can have a strong hand), and on the other hand 3@h is way more ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|game over: and usually a plus point: you don't have the @h A, which is a big minus here|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  If this is what 3@H can be in second seat, I need more to double 4@S.|pg||
