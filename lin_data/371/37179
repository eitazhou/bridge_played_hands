nt|bagman: If South can describe his hand fully|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: this might take a while|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer can come and go in spades, cash the clubs and play double squeeze (which is simple against South)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: S thinking about playing a @s?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low diamond might be the best shot now but S has to be sure about the position; otherwise it's a gift|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: will that cause some kind of problems?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wins spade in hand, cashes the clubs discarding a heart and a diamond and continues spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to do right guesses, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: now @d5 in hand ... I believe that Mats Nilsland has a full picture of the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: and has been thinking the same as "us"|pg||

nt|warrens:  3@c seems very reasonable and 5@c hard to avoid when partner bids 3@d.  not sure who to blame here|pg||

nt|warrens:  all West needed was q@d & K of @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: and W really looks like a player that knows this is impossible|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: Welcome Pekka :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like a dullish spade game but one never knows|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzbn: 1nt = 15-17|pg||
nt|bagman: This might get the spades buried|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: 2@d = transfer to 2@h|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|bagman: NS convention card states that 5M seldom in 1NT and also seldom 5422; Mats has both now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzbn: but 3nt not in jeopardy |pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT is a sound contract, especially when played by south|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: so no real problem this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: West might subscribe to theory that you need not to set up an ace and lead a diamond|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|bagman: The spade game is not so great, but vulnerable many have bid worse; this time there are 10 tricks with the lucky club position|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: but I cant imagine he will play other than a @c|pg||
nt|bagman: This removes an entry from dummy and makes the handling of the hand trickier in 3@S; in 4@S E should just hope that spades break and clubs are like they are (or AQ )|pg||
