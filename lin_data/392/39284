nt|glen: W finds this poker game interesting|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Smith will obviously raise, but the @d suit misbehaves|pg||

nt|vugraphzbm: Smith has a tough one now  he writes to ZYg does XX show spades ?|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Other table on Board 8 and on smoke break|pg||
nt|glen: I like X first, since some hands there is slam, I don't think 3@H is a good idea|pg||

nt|jonottawa: sticks and wheels at least|pg||
nt|jonottawa: 5 trumps and 4 side top tricks|pg||
nt|glen: yes, there are some positions where W ruffs in with only trump left|pg||
nt|glen: if the D muffs up|pg||
nt|glen: getting only 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: good thing for kibz is  no one is withdrawing  still qite a close match|pg||
nt|glen: switch to a small @C?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|glen: or even a big @C|pg||
nt|jonottawa: that was strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: 10@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: in hand|pg||
nt|zind:  seemed reasonable, he doesnt know whats happening with the clubs, and this breaks up some cumminication|pg||
nt|glen: well, he should wait 5 minutes, then play @S T|pg||
nt|zind:  communication*|pg||
nt|zind:  this would seem like a tough position sitting N only seeing your hand and dummy|pg||
nt|jonottawa: fair enough, it looked strange but yeah he doesn't want to underlead and lose to AJ tight in clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|jonottawa: declarer a pretty heavy favorite to have a doubleton @s though|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jonottawa: now huang doing the old 'if you don't want them to lead a suit, lead it first' |pg||
nt|jonottawa: though he's just playing for 3-3 @c actually|pg||
nt|glen: N can now read @C 8, and play @C 3|pg||
nt|glen: N could be in endplay city in the reds|pg||
nt|glen: later|pg||
nt|jonottawa: N should know 100% that @c is only chance to be right, E is marked with @dAK and @h97|pg||
nt|glen: if he plays a high @C, it is neat that the @C 5 sets up|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jonottawa: was just thinking same|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jonottawa: he worked it out|pg||
nt|glen: S should play any @D|pg||
nt|zind:  so E wins and cashs a club and playes 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|zind:  i think that killes N|pg||
nt|glen: yup|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Throw N in with the long @c?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|TopWizard:  Red suit endplay?|pg||
nt|zind:  depends what poision N chooses|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Or is the E hand squeezed in the process?|pg||
nt|glen: he can't pitch the @C or two @Hs|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  But N squeezed first it seems|pg||
nt|glen: talking about N, can't pitch two @H or @C|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  E's @d8 very powerful, S can't guard @d's|pg||
nt|glen: but can't afford two @D pitches either|pg||
nt|glen: so N is sqz'd before E is|pg||
nt|zind:  its looks like a 3 suited squeeze baiscally|pg||
nt|glen: so we claim as specs here|pg||
nt|zind:  and N must keep his LHO guard suit to stop it from repeating|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: evryone realises it s a toughie|pg||
nt|glen: N should pitch @D 7 and T, hiding @D 9|pg||
nt|zind:  N must guard clubs to stop the squeeze from repeating|pg||
nt|zind:  his RHO i guess|pg||
nt|glen: (you are not frozen, declarer is)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: yes sorry  S took awhile  now E|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: every one would like the play to go faster bt all 4 players realize it s a very tip n go hand|pg||
nt|glen: I think that declarer doesn't believe it could be true, but still wondering if N if just a chance could have stiff @SK|pg||
nt|glen: since S has been known to make less that perfect bids before|pg||
nt|zind:  i think he is trying to out what diamond to play, to create the desired end position|pg||
nt|jonottawa: I think he's deciding where he wants to go for dinner|pg||
nt|glen: that makes the most sense|pg||
nt|glen: something like club diamond|pg||
nt|glen: (a place in Montreal)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|zind:	plus all this analysis take much longer single dummy|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|glen: N hides the @D 9|pg||
nt|zind:  this seemingly works as well|pg||
nt|jonottawa: and after all that thought he gets it wrong|pg||
nt|zind:  right kib points out DQ kills it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: now fred in the tank|pg||
