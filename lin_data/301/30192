nt|ahollan1: 3@H = MAX, 4@S & 6+@H, 0/1 loser suit     seems like overbid to me|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|c5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at minimum, needs @H10 or 9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dbl me:  agree rather optimistic|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: especially with slow values in @S where partner is known to be short|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: but next time  east will have @SQ instead of @CQ and @CA instead of @DA|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: strong 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pass usually 0-7|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dbl me:  Note the disciplined NV/V pass in 2nd seat by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|dbl me:  ...now "compensated" by a game bid in spades  :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would never pass north hand -- looks like either 3@S or multi 2@D opener to me|pg||
nt|dbl me:  I agree...if it is a preemptive hand, treat it as such even in 2nd seat.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://livebridge.net/bbo/session.php?eventid=1013&sessionid=2  will have buttons to see table lineups  15 min before game time|pg||
nt|dbl me:  N is buttressed by his nice d fit, figuring that 4H must be there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some very cool web pages available for this event|pg||

nt|dbl me:  ...or a low spade if a sp. is led by W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 8 hcp, west wouldn't PASS over 2@D|pg||
nt|dbl me:  valid point|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: so maybe @HK would have been better|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think declarer needed to think about west's DBL a bit longer   before 1st round of trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot to check to see who our operator was :(	 but it was a nicely managed set|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Y, sometimes hard to sit back and reflect a while on the last board.|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: that's it for our table -- MANY vugraph tables still in play|pg||
nt|DavidStern:	the power went down in the server room|pg||
