nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in this room  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure.|pg||
nt|kit: This is thin enough contract to begin with, and when the club finesse lses to the stiff queen it will be a lot thinner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Moss thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: @s towards the jack maybe|pg||

nt|ritong: yo|pg||
nt|bt:	there is a winning line if west is 5521|pg||
nt|bt:	as we can see|pg||
nt|ritong: imo brad very seriously considers a @c to the K|pg||
nt|ritong: or @c K from hand after some other play|pg||
nt|kit: even if club to king drops stiff queen, I still don't see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bt:	diamond to king, then @C K, is tempting?|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|kit: at best 2 tricks in each suit, unless there is something I don't see|pg||
nt|ritong: three @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: @c 9 hook|pg||
nt|bt:	and running the @C8 you are still in dummy to play @D|pg||
nt|bt:	in case you need to|pg||
nt|bt:	then again we see all 4 hands, moss doesnt|pg||
nt|kit: then how does he lead up to diamonds twice?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sixela: club lead is most natural|pg||

nt|nilsland:  I dont know what Dbl would be over 2@C, cards or clubs? |pg||
nt|djneill:  low spade from table now might work well|pg||

nt|LC:	Hi (fro, 35,000 feet)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Grue asked Kalita about discards|pg||

nt|sixela: trump leads would have made life more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: good chance for Grue here   3NT failing by 2 OR|pg||
nt|Allan Falk: Soft defense here--a spade return would have put Morgan to committing himself earlier than he would have liked, but will probably make easily by ruffing two hearts in hand.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  seems best to play on @D3-2 by ruffing 2 hearts|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nilsland:  ruffing one @H is enough but declarer doesnt know that|pg||
nt|Allan Falk: But E needs mirrors to get the spades right; with such weak diamond spots in hand, can't figure why he want to ruff in dummy|pg||

nt|ritong: keep pedalling, lars|pg||
nt|bt:	i did, interesting project|pg||
nt|LC:	Once Ear opens, West likely to drive to doomed (very doomed) 3NT.|pg||
nt|bt:	and, as we see here, very successful :)|pg||
nt|LC:	Sorry for the typo (the airplane is bumpy) ;)|pg||
nt|bt:	now, if east is allowed to open, maybe west should be a little cautious?, like inviting game?|pg||
nt|ritong: we are in a turbulences zone  please fasten your seat belts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: getting to a 24 HCP 3NT vulnerable isn't the worst thing a pair can do|pg||
nt|ritong: ask meckwell|pg||
nt|LC:	That's quite a view with an okay 12 vulnerable to only invite at IMPs -- but a winning view here.|pg||
nt|bt:	and allowing partner to evaluate is also a good thing|pg||
nt|kit: Particularly since when things lie badly sometimes 2NT doesn't make either, so cost is only 3 IMPs instead of 6 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|LC:  I know Meckwell would be in 3NT. :)|pg||

nt|bt:	about seeding, didnt grue finish very high in 2-3 recent nationals, and the polish team is full of national team players?|pg||
nt|bt:	so their seed here was surprising|pg||
nt|LC:	Based on how good they seem, surely Bridge24 deserved better than 39-seed -- but they had no seeding points and the committee has to guess to some degree.|pg||
nt|LC:	As far sar Grue, it is based purely on seeding points earned over previous years.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: after this hand players will take a short break|pg||
nt|bt:	just this final wasnt the huge upset it looks on paper|pg||
nt|LC:	The players on Monaco, Nickell, Diamond, Fleisher, etc. all had more seeding points than Grue's team.|pg||
nt|LC:	The field is so full of talented players that is is impossible to predict -- sort of like trying to predict the winner at a MAJOR golf tournament.|pg||
nt|bt:	Stenson i guess :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Moss hasn't turned his card yet, still looking at the last trick|pg||

nt|LC:	At the start of the Vanderbilt or Spingold, if I offered you either "the top 4 seeds" or "everyone else" what would you take?|pg||

nt|LC:	In the Round of 8 they held the NICKELL team to an incredibly low IMP total.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Roland, when do you think the Vanderbilt and Spingold should become official World Championship events?|pg||

nt|bt:	thing is, over a west double, east might bid 4@C|pg||
nt|LC:	If West bids 3@S, the question is whether or not East will offer a 4@H control-bid, or simply raise to 4@S.|pg||
nt|bt:	west might try 3nt, someone has to bid it|pg||
nt|LC:	If he doubles, why wouldn't East bid 3@S?|pg||

nt|Henryb:  Is double takeout, penalty, or cards?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|LC:  Without knowing their exact methods, it is just a general "rule" that double in these situations is "cards"|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Allan Falk: Jag did not rate his hand a 2@h overcall; perhaps 3@h would have asked for heart stop for 3NT|pg||

nt|nilsland:  lets see - it will be exciting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as little as @C10 instead of @Cx makes this slam|pg||
nt|Allan Falk: E needs 7 trump tricks to go with his 5 side suit winners; might be doable but has to cash one trump and whichever high one he plays seems fatal|pg||

mb|3N|nt|ritong: raising @hs an option too imo|pg||
nt|LC:	I like 3NT -- and after @D lead will be interesting.|pg||
nt|ritong: but that would sterilize @d K|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|LC:  Will be very exicitng to see if he finesses @S8.   South's 9 could easily include the @S10.|pg||
nt|LC:	Which @D will Moss lead?   (or maybe a @H?)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|LC:  He can win, @SJ, @CQ and then finesse @S8?|pg||
nt|bt:	south might lead something neutral|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|LC:	So, declarer can, of course, guess spades and eventurally exit in @H to endplay South -- but that is looking at all the cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: and the lead does not help to figure hands out|pg||
nt|Henryb:  He can also just play on hearts|pg||
nt|LC:	But, if South shows up with 1-1 in blacks, not so double-dummy.|pg||
nt|LC:	Playing on @H is scary, since it is hard to imagine it wouldn't let North in.|pg||
nt|bt:	if he plays another club, he will se the lead is a singleton|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I agree Larry|pg||
nt|ritong: after that lead one tends to imagine south has 7 @ds and 3@cs|pg||
nt|bt:	and wonder why south did not lead a spade|pg||
nt|LC:	If he guesses spades, he is likely to fall into making it -- as anything he tries has to work.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: discussion about leads, after preempt, lead of 9 is standard|pg||
nt|mareczek: zator odczyta pewnie aluzje :)|pg||
nt|LC:	But, is there a clear reason why he should guess spades. The @S9 could event be from @S109x (not to mention 10-9 doubleton).|pg||
nt|mareczek: sorry priv|pg||
nt|bt:	regardless of the clubs, wouldnt south lead a spade with T9 doubleton?|pg||
nt|LC:	Well, @S is the one suit declarer will hold on this auction -- so not attractive to lead them.|pg||
nt|mareczek: guessing spades would be the fine piece of card reading|pg||
nt|bt:	anyway we are speculating, kalita has to play it :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Grue clarified it would be unusul for Moss to hold 10@c, unless he is being tricky|pg||
nt|LC:	There is a little bit of a restricted choice issue when the @S9 is played (since with @S109 doubleton, it is 50-50 as to which South would play) -- but there is also @S109x to think about.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|bt:	one question is where declarer gets his 9th trick|pg||
nt|ritong: "restricted choice" is really a last resort gimmick imho|pg||
nt|bt:	1471 vulnerable against not is one option|pg||
nt|ritong: there are usually so many stronger clues|pg||

nt|DavidStern: In the OR declarer won the club lead with dummy's queen cashed one heart and finessed the spade 8 and exited a heart to endplay South|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mareczek: well bid to the slam at OR|pg||
nt|DavidStern: After 8 days of bridge I'm bridged OUT so excuse my believing other commentators and being too laxy to work it out for myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|Allan Falk: David, you've already apologized for being old, ignorant, and Aussie--now you're adding tired to the list?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nilsland:  the slam is much better on West's hand, if both Kings should be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|Allan Falk: :)|pg||
nt|DavidStern: So 22 in last two boards impressive but a LOOOOONNNNGGG way to go|pg||
nt|ady: thx Joe      thx all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|DavidStern: Never apologised for being Aussie|pg||
nt|DavidStern: And never will|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: most play 4N as quantitative|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
nt|ritong: no doubt about that|pg||
nt|Tez: 4nt is quantitative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it fails to show the 6th @S|pg||
nt|ritong: and west can hardly have a better hand|pg||
nt|Allan Falk: W has a primey 16 with great spades; he'll accept|pg||
nt|DavidStern: Just to clarify I have apologised for being old tired and too trusting of other commentators anallysis|pg||
nt|DavidStern: Quantitiative with choice of contract options later on|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I never trust even my own analysis|pg||
nt|DavidStern: I always trust it I have 3000 kibbitzers to tell me when its wrong |pg||
nt|nilsland:  and I am usually right in that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expected hand for east after transfer/4N	is  5@S(332) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: with same strength as  1N-4N|pg||
nt|ady: west gave an acceptance of spades in OR   responded 2NT to 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I think Amoils wrote something about definitely bidding slam; he may be considering a trying for a grand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  plenty of kibs agree|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: then he just bid 6@S and laughed.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|DavidStern: It depends on Agreements. I agree with partner no such thing as 3 card super accept but with 3 Aces and a King this is a fine hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i see growing number of pairs using 2N to show  support of Honor Honor - 3rd|pg||
pc|s9|nt|DavidStern: 3-3 with king onside in clubs - never happens to me when I get to the bad grand|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the idea is similar to transfer to minor and "accept" with good fit because of possible running suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Allan Falk: W not working hard from here as 6 cold at this point|pg||
mc|13|nt|ady: thx all	  bye|pg||
