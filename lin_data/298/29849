nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: grue: if we tie we do it again and if we tie that, me and kalita go into a cage|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: other table is playing 2@c by north|pg||
nt|jkotor: now, another @h prevents cross-ruffs|pg||
nt|ritong: admittedly, he hits bull s eye more often than most of his colleagues|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@C unbal and not 3@S|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c pretty weird whatever the methods are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 1N would show hand TOO STRONG for 1N opener|pg||
nt|pelu:  N cant bid 1Nt = 18+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: some people use a 2@h response to 1@c to show 5-4 in the majors, less than invitational|pg||
nt|adamw:  Hi everyone!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Grue-Moss playing Precision non-vul  2/1 vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bertheau asked about whether 2@c denies 3 @ss and Gawel said usually, but there might be a hand with a very good club suit and 3 spades and minimum that would bid 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect 1@D - 2@H as suggested|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now Bertheau asks whether 2@c promised 6 clubs and G says no, could be 5 with 4 @ds|pg||
nt|adamw:  Thrilling match here in Atlanta.|pg||
nt|dburn: hello Adam|pg||
nt|adamw:  I don't have my headset with me, so written commentary will have to do.|pg||
nt|pelu:  when was the last time - if ever - with a play off?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Before they sat down, Thomas said to me "I wanted to ask you if it mattered" (the defense on the last board) :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Obviously they all knew the match was close, but not how close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as predicted other table	1@D[2+] - 2@H - end|pg||
nt|dburn: well, both contracts will probably scrape home, but hearts score more than clubs, so Grue may pull ahead in the early going|pg||

nt|adamw:  Is this their first NABC?|pg||
nt|dburn: but one of the most up-to-date websites I have ever seen|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|adamw:  Nick Nickell says they played well against his team.|pg||
nt|mareczek: no - Kalita palyed in USA from a few years, with Gawrys and Jessica Piafsky|pg||
nt|adamw:  But then, they would have had to to win.|pg||
nt|dburn: especially when you consider than it takes twice as long to type stuff in Polish as anything else|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|adamw:  A great showing for their first NABC outing as a team, whether 1st or 2nd.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|adamw:  8 tricks in 2@c as expected.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this has been the year of 4-person teams in finals   winning Vanderbilt, Open USA1, Women's USA2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: They're all very nice and have spelled their names for me each time I ask (which is probably more often than I should have to)|pg||
mb|d|nt|adamw:	Your name is difficult to spell too!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|adamw:  zfc indeed...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: DBL ??|pg||
nt|mareczek: the times they are changing - in a few yeras their names will be well known :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Marek  we need you |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe a transfer to notrump|pg||
nt|adamw:  Are NS using a Polish Club?|pg||
nt|dburn: no, not quite|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I remember when I thought Zmudzinski was hard to spell :), now I can handle Jagniewski :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither Bridge24 pair plays  Polish Club or Strefa [with 2-way 1@C opener]|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mareczek: NS play short club with transfer responses after 1@c and many relays|pg||
mb|p|nt|adamw:	I'm told NS's methods are more like the Roy Welland system than a Polish club.|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@c is Polish-like, but not the full Monty - transfer responses rather than 1@d negative, etc|pg||
nt|mareczek: North has shown forcing hand with clubs (2@c direct would be free negative)|pg||
nt|adamw:  So balanced hands with no 5-card major are opened 1C or 1N.|pg||
nt|dburn: so double here is maybe clubs, maybe notrump (not sure)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: but Marek says clubs, so clubs it is :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  1  2@H in the Moysian made on time  for   1 imp to Grue|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@s is consistent with 18-19 balanced (indeed, that's probably what it ought to be)|pg||
nt|adamw:  12 easy tricks in NT from the South side, but tough to reach slam.|pg||
nt|mareczek: they play 1nt 14-16 1st 2nd and 3rd, so he ha shown 17-19|pg||
nt|dburn: OK|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|pelu:  only loosing slam is 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not so tough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gawel's final pass was a shrug :)|pg||
nt|adamw:  Well bid, I think...|pg||
nt|mareczek: wow|pg||
nt|adamw:  Great spot, anyway.|pg||
nt|adamw:  Poland has been a force to be reckoned with in the bridge world for many years.|pg||
nt|adamw:  It's good to see the younger generation in action.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue-Moss play 2/1 when vul   they seem to be struggling with auction on this hand .... standby|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in 6@C north|pg||
nt|mareczek: Grue is in 6@c from the wrong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C by north in open room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bertheau asked some questions and Gawel answered, whispers too low for me to hear either of them - now about the DBL and what it showed but I still can't get the answer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but diamond lead|pg||
nt|mareczek: but Kalita did not led pard suit...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mareczek: any way, NT pays more than clubs :)|pg||
nt|adamw:  Kit Woolsey has a theory that the most important bidding decisions are choice of slam auctions.|pg||
nt|adamw:  He has convinced me.|pg||
nt|mareczek: and six level multiplies more than two :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  what a PR for Bridge24 - 2 day ago almost none outside Poland know the procect - now known world wide|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|adamw:  Heart to the Ace protects against singleton K on the W hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this may be another swing - two back to Bridge24, who will regain the lead|pg||
nt|adamw:  But...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gawel: "sorry". Jag: "we have time till the plane, so ... about 15 hours"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: "so take your time"|pg||
nt|adamw:  The overcall pretty much marks the @HK offside, otherwise the finesse would be better, because declarer can revert to spades if West has a small @H singleton.|pg||
nt|adamw:  8 boards in the playoff.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: can he do anything about it if hearts are 5-1?|pg||
nt|dburn: depends which 5-1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: weak 2@H/@S opener or strong with primary @D  [i think]|pg||
nt|dburn: in an 8-board playoff you may need to estimate your score if you have a close decision late on. Should Grue consider that he might have won a big swing when they didn't lead a ...|pg||
nt|dburn: spade against six clubs?|pg||
nt|mareczek: Gawe³ did not open 2@h (5-5, weak, @h+m) because of the spade fit|pg||
nt|dburn: Bertheau, on the other hand, opened a Multi even though he had three hearts. You pays your money, and...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|adamw:  I don't think Bessis' 3@H would be a popular choice.|pg||

nt|Tez: other table playing 3@c dbl..looks like 2 down|pg||
nt|adamw:  Had Bessis passed over 3@C he might have got a crack at 4@D anyway.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: by doubling 3@H did he not convert double of 3@S into optional instead of penalty|pg||
nt|mareczek: taking into account tactics|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the rolling on gestures were about the DBL of 3@s|pg||

nt|robinswr: i'd bid 3@h over 2@s|pg||
nt|jkotor: would somebody shift to @d here?|pg||
nt|robinswr: If you don't bid 3@h partner might jump to five clubs if he had six clubs and four hearts|pg||
nt|jkotor: knowing KJT even i would, but close cards?|pg||
nt|kit: he has to take heart finesse without cashing ace of hearts I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: brad asks to see the opps convention card for the first time in 50 boards|pg||
