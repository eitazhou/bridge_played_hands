nt|bjacobs:  This is an interesting board.  A lot of people might bid this pair of balanced hands to 3NT: it's a popular approach.  But here 4@H is 110% the right contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  North was up for 3NT, but South cast a disapproving eye on his low spade doubleton. Well done!|pg||

nt|game over: glad that Bill Jacobs is here, he wrote an excellent book about Fantunes (NS's system), so he knows the system inside out :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The jump shows 5-5 ... they start their game forcing spade hands with a transfer to 2@H|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  So now they are cueing, I suppose, and South reveals which suit he is cueing for, via 4@H|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The 2@H bid denied 4 hearts, so Fantoni has a tough problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The @SQ is a magical card|pg||
nt|Tez: http://www.cavendishmonaco.com/index.php?option=com_bridgeresultats&view=resultats&layout=sessnrnk&rep=2014_2en&session=1&lang=en|pg||
nt|game over: is 4@c a forced Cue-Bid and would have 3NT (instead of 4@c) denied a fit?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  So Fantoni cues spades, and 4NT will show two key-cards for herats|pg||
nt|game over: (maybe 4@c sets hearts and is not a cuebid at all)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:	Well, I'm not sure, despite your sterling introduction to me :)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|Tez: 6NT best for match point|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|game over: 6NT is still slightly better in case spades are 5-1 (or some other very unlikely ruffs) and you have an unlikely squeeze, but still a very good effort and I think they will win ...|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  I would have bid at the 1-level myself|pg||
