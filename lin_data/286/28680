nt|KingCur: N not getting the message of 3 key cards, I presume, but they have to be @SAK and @CA for 7|pg||
nt|davidb: why wait now? |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|KingCur: it's maybe a fair gamble to credit EW for having @HA, but it's a gamble that needs some explanation to team mates when wrong :)|pg||
nt|davidb: 99 % A h with vul opponents	bidding so|pg||
nt|KingCur: Westra-Ramond had an undisturbed auction: 1@C-1@S, after which N could splinter 4@H|pg||
nt|KingCur: that made life somewhat easier|pg||
nt|KingCur: lots of specs asking why N didnt bid 5@H iso 4NT: would 5@H be void showing or exclusion blackwood, david? and would you bid 5@H with two aceless long suits?|pg||
nt|KingCur: kibs also suggesting N could have bid 6@H over 5@D|pg||
nt|davidb: 5H was alternative but not exc  . no sure way  to 7 .i like practical 4nt|pg||
nt|KingCur: since 0 key cards in S is very very unlikely|pg||
nt|davidb: all good suggestion but not sure for this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: we were in 7 @S at our table|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello all |pg||
nt|davidb: just bid it Alon  ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello again David,	here you are :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|KingCur: 6@H over 5@D can maybe only mean "pd I have a void in @H: are you looking at the right keycards?". But it's always depending on other agreements the partnership has|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: this had been a fascinating match |pg||
mc|13|nt|KingCur: it's getting nicely busy here at the end of the set: welcome Shirley :)|pg||
nt|KingCur: fast claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: This was the last board of this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: We start again at 16.00, 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|KingCur: score still tied, since Israel won 12 on  13|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will commend Schwartz at our table to dealing with (succesfully) some difficult hands |pg||
nt|vugraphzae: Thanks all and see you in 25 minutes|pg||
nt|KingCur: making 2@S here, and EW in 5@C other room|pg||
