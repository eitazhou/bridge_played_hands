mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5N!|an|pick a slam|mb|p|nt|vugraphzcu: a jump to 5NT is pick a slam according to CC|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: but here they already showed good @dfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Padon probably intending 5NT as asking for good @ds here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 5NT should have a rather clear meaning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: as there is lots of room to investigate other things|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: kib points out that 6@c better on this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: but not sure if 6@c would lead to success|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: you need a 12th trick somewhere: 6@c 3@h 1@s 1@d to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: setting up @s needs @sK to drop in 3 rounds, or 4 rounds +@h finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: ah, give up a @s helps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 6@d CAN make, but needs inspired declarer play|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: by leading 9 from North|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 9-J-Q-K and finesse the 10 or 9-7-3-10 and lead @dQ later|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: intrafinessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: but i think leading to @dQ is better odds|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: as it only requires @dK onside (assuming 3-2 of course)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: but sometimes you know the King is over the Queen from the bidding|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzcu: all about @ds here, we'll see|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: in practice most East would rise with @dK from Kx|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: so playing @d9 from dummy and looking what East does is free|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: if East ducks smoothly you might decide he doesn't have the @dK and play low in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: actually not a free as it seems as East can have a singleton honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: and lack of entries to North |pg||

nt|Gerben42:  west opened a Multi with a terrible suit but good distribution|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  both 4@H and 4@S are good contracts but fail due to the bad trump breaks|pg||
